# ddpizza - Domain Driven Pizzeria 

![Pizza Constructivism by DALLE](img/pizza_dalle.png "DALLE AI created this modernist painting in the style of Constructivism painting of pizza where half of the pizza is made by electronic bits and the other half is normal.")

A sandbox project for learning about DDD principles in python.
A lot of it is based on this book: Architecture Patterns with Python by Harry Percival & Bob Gregory.
At least as a starting point.
